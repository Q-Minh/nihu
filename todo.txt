NiHu toolbox improvement ideas and TODO:
	- make model_mkc faster for infinite elements
	- FEM/IEM multiple frequency solvers
	- indirect BEM / indirect multipole BEM
	- IEM: support for Jacobi polynomial based solution
	- IEM: project nodes from section
	- INVMAP: bounding box for infinite elements faster
	- IEM: Rewrite matrix generation files for new IE_SHAPE functions
	- TEST: write test files for packages
	- DEMO: invmap demo
