TODO

- NSet Acceleration in double_integral
- Accelerators should be stored outside of double_integral

- Store Dual kernels (H and G) in double integral result
- double_integral::eval_on_quadrature accelerated by splitting N K N' into N (K N')

- element::id_t is Eigen::Matrix(1,1) currently. Does it make sense?

DONE

- test copy constructor calls in call_each


Dirac field support
=========================

What is needed from a kernel_input field?
-----------------------------------------

-	double_integral  -	nothing more than evaluating the kernel in x0
-	weighted_residual -	get_dofs() return
